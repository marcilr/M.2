M.2, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF),
is a specification for internally mounted computer expansion
cards and associated connectors.  It replaces the mSATA standard,
which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical card layout and
connectors.  M.2's more flexible physical specification allows
different module widths and lengths, and, paired with the
availability of more advanced interfacing features, makes the
M.2 more suitable than mSATA for solid-state storage applications
in general and particularly for the use in small devices such as
ultrabooks or tablets.[1][2][3]
